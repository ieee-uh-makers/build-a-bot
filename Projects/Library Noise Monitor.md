## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial for the Bluetooth Serial - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read sound sensor
2. If noise is above certain point, drive LED **OR** buzzer **OR** send alert over bluetooth
