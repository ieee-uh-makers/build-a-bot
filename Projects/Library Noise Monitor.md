# Library Noise Monitor
Automatically alerts staff when the noise levels in the library become distracting for people studying there

## Hardware
- Sound Sensor
- Buzzer **OR** LED

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. TODO

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read sound sensor
2. If noise is above certain point, drive LED **OR** buzzer

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Scoring
