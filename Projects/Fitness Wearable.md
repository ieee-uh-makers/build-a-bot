# Fitness Wearable
Wearable device that tracks number of steps, estimates calories burnt

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano / MSP430
- IMU
- Bluetooth UART

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. IMU - TODO
2. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial for the Bluetooth Serial https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read IMU
2. Analyze IMU readings, determine if a step was taken
3. Send steps over bluetooth

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Scoring
### Sensors (40 points possible)
Points are given once the sensors are demonstrated working with your project.

- IMU - 20 Points
- Bluetooth Option: Bluetooth Sensor - 20 Points

### Progress (50-60 points possible)
