# Fitness Wearable
Tracks number of steps, estimates calories burnt

## Hardware
- IMU
- Bluetooth UART

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. IMU - TODO
2. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read IMU
2. Analyze IMU readings, determine if a step was taken
3. Send steps over bluetooth

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.
