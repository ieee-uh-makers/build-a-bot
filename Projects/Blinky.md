## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read button
2. Do something cool with the LED (pulse on / off, modulate PWM, etc)
