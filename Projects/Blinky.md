# Blinky: Recommended Beginner Project
Use a button to control an LED

## Hardware
- Arduino Nano / MSP430
- Button
- LED

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. TODO

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read button
2. Do something cool with the LED (pulse on / off, modulate PWM, etc)

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Scoring
### Sensors (20 points possible)
- LED - 10 Points
- Button - 10 Points

### Progress (40 points possible)
