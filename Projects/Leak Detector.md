# Leak Detector
Sounds an alarm whenever a leak under the sink is detected

## Options

### LED or Buzzer Alert
Alarm is signaled using an LED or buzzer

### Bluetooth Serial Alert
Alarm is signaled by sending an alarm message over bluetooth

## Hardware
- Water Level Sensor
- LED / Buzzer Option: Buzzer **OR** LED
- Bluetooth Option: Bluetooth UART

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read water level sensor
2. If level is above a certain threshold, drive LED **OR** buzzer **OR** sends alarm over bluetooth

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.
