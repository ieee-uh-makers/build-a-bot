# HVAC Patrol Robot
Robot that patrols a building computing statistics about temperature and humidity to improve temperature consistency. Statistics computed include the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of the following:

- Temperature
- Humidity

## Options
### Manual Control
The robot will be controlled with a joystick

### Autonomous Control
The robot will be automatically controlled using the ultrasonic rangefinder, turning whenever it gets too close to an object.

## Hardware
- Arduino Nano / MSP430
- Racer Bot
- LCD *or* Bluetooth Serial
- Manual Control Only: Joystick
- Autonomous Control Only: Ultrasonic Rangefinder

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. Racer: https://github.com/ieee-uh-makers/build-a-bot
2. Bluetooth: SoftwareSerial - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

## Autonomous loop() Pseudocode
1. Read ultrasonic sensor range
2. If an object is not nearby, move forwards
3. If an object is nearby, turn right or left
4. Read / store temperature and humidity
5. Compute Statistics
6. Display Statistics to LCD or send them over Bluetooth

## Manual Control loop() Pseudocode
1. Read the joystick
2. Move in the direction of the joystick using the Racer library
3. Read / store temperature and humidity
4. Compute Statistics
5. Display Statistics to LCD or send them over Bluetooth

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.
