# Weather Monitoring Station
Device that stays outside recording weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and rain.

## Options

### Bluetooth Serial
The measurements are sent wirelessly over bluetooth to a computer

### LCD
The conditions are displayed on an LCD

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano / MSP430
- Temperature / Humidity Sensor
- Rain Sensor
- Bluetooth Option: Bluetooth Serial
- LCD Option: LCD

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial for the Bluetooth Serial - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial
2. LCD Option: LCD - TODO

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read temperature, humidty and rain sensors.
2. Transmit them over bluetooth at a regular interval

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.
