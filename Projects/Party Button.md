## Hardware Required
- Breadboard & Jumper Cables
- Arduino Nano / MSP432 Launchpad
- Button

## Recommended Hardware
- Laser Emitter
- RGB LED
- Buzzer
- Volume Sensor
- Servo Motor

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Read button
2. If button pressed, set timer to 60 seconds
3. While timer is not expired, do crazy party visualizations
4. When the timer expires, end the party

## Scoring

### Progress
The more you complete, the more points you will based on the difficulty level of the project.
- Setup Arduino / Energia Project
- Wiring
- Button starts party sequence
- Your lighting and sound elements are awesome
- Everything turns off before the fuzz shows up (60 seconds)

### Subjective
Judges assess you project and pitch in various ways giving you additional points
- Sales Pitch: pitch your project to a judge
- Next Steps: presenting next steps to improve device/robot
- Originality / Innovation
- Project Neatness
