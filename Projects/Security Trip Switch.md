## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.

## Hardware Setup
- TODO: Link to schematic

## Libraries Used
1. Bluetooth Option: SoftwareSerial for the Bluetooth Serial (9600 Baud, Key: 1234) - https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

## loop() Pseudocode
1. Check if laser is interrupted
2. If laser is interrupted, drive LED **OR** buzzer **OR** sends alarm over bluetooth
