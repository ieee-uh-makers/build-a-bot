# Sensors from a Hat
You pick four sensors from a hat and have to do something useful with them. You can choose additional sensors, but you MUST use the four random sensors you chose for your project.

## Hardware Used
- Breadboard & Jumper Cables
- Arduino Nano / MSP432 Launchpad
- 5 Random Sensors

## Scoring

### Progress
- Setup Arduino / Energia Project
- Wiring
- Do something useful

### Subjective
- Sales Pitch: pitch your project to a judge
- Completion: demonstrate your complete project working
- Next Steps: presenting next steps to improve device/robot
- Originality / Innovation
- Project Neatness

## Ask-an-Expert
You may consult with a facilitator to help you solve a problem three times at no penalty. After three times, you will no longer have priority, so use them wisely.
